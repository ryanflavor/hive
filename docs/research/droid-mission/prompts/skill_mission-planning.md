# Mission Planning

This skill guides you through the planning phase.

## Phase 1: Understand & Plan (DYNAMIC, ITERATIVE)

This is the most important phase. Your goal is to arrive at a deep, comprehensive understanding of: what we're building, how it works architecturally, where complexity lives, what user-facing surfaces exist, and what the approach should be.

**Start by asking the user** enough questions to build shared understanding of what we're building and what matters \u2014 so that all subsequent investigation has direction. Ask as many as make sense in one go. Don't start investigating until these are answered.

**Then interleave these activities as needed** \u2014 the problem dictates the path:
- **Investigate** the codebase and technologies via subagents. Delegate deep investigation \u2014 code reading, flow tracing, module analysis, operational discovery. You handle structural overview (READMEs, configs, directory layouts) and synthesize subagent reports.
- **Research** technologies where your training knowledge may be insufficient. Follow the Online Research guidelines \u2014 delegate to subagents.
- **Identify testing surfaces** \u2014 where behavior can be tested through user-facing boundaries (browser UI, CLI, API). Delegate architectural analysis to subagents when assessing this.
- **Think through the approach** \u2014 how will this be built, what are the boundaries, where will workers need the most guidance? For any deep thinking or thorough analysis, delegate to subagents.
- **Ask again** if investigation reveals new ambiguities.

**Always delegate deep investigation and deep thinking to subagents.** Your context window is finite \u2014 preserve it for orchestration, synthesis, and user interaction. When you need thorough analysis of any aspect (architectural decomposition, surface identification, technology assessment, edge case enumeration), spawn a subagent.

### Iterative Exploration Loop

Planning is not a single pass of investigation followed by a proposal. After each round of investigation, explicitly enumerate what you still don't know and assess which unknowns matter most. For each high-importance unknown, either investigate via subagent or ask the user. Then re-assess \u2014 did exploration surface new unknowns? Keep going until nothing important is left unexplored.

Continue until you can answer these questions about every part of the system you're building:
- What does it do?
- What are its boundaries?
- Where does complexity concentrate?
- How would an independent party verify it works?

If you can't answer these, you don't understand the problem well enough yet. Keep investigating.

**Keep in mind:** Your understanding here directly informs the validation contract \u2014 the behavioral assertions that define "done." The contract will need assertions for every surface you identify. Shallow understanding produces shallow contracts, which produce shallow validation.

Only move forward when you have a clear, deep picture of what success looks like.

## Phase 2: Infrastructure & Boundaries

Determine what infrastructure is needed:
- What services? (databases, caches, queues, etc.)
- What processes? (API server, web frontend, workers, etc.)
- What ports will each need?
- Any external APIs or resources?

**IMPORTANT: Proactively check what's already running.**

e.g.
\`\`\`bash
# Check listening ports
lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN

# Check running containers
docker ps

# Check running node/python processes
ps aux | grep -E 'node|python|java' | grep -v grep

etc.
\`\`\`

Analyze the output to:
- Identify ports already in use (avoid conflicts)
- Find existing services you can reuse (e.g., existing postgres on 5432)
- Discover processes that might conflict with your mission
- Note any ports/directories that should be off-limits

Present needed infrastructure and how they fit with the user's setup:

\`\`\`
This mission will need:
- Postgres database (may I use the existing one on 5432?)
- API server on port 3100
- [etc.]

Does this setup work for you?
\`\`\`

**You need explicit user confirmation to proceed.**

## Phase 3: Set Up Credentials & Accounts (INTERACTIVE)

If the mission involves any external dependencies (APIs, databases, auth providers, third-party SDKs), you must set up real credentials and connections so the mission can be validated end-to-end. This is not optional \u2014 the default is real integration, not mocks.

For greenfield projects, this likely means all credentials and accounts. For existing codebases, investigate what's already configured and only set up what's missing.

If new credentials/accounts are needed:
1. If they don't already exist, initialize any needed configuration files first (e.g., \`.env\` files with variable names and placeholder values), so the user has somewhere to put them.
2. Guide the user through the specific steps to create any needed accounts and generate credentials, providing clear instructions and links.

**CRITICAL: During this step, we must set up everything such that the mission can be validated end-to-end with real integrations.** Workers must be able to test against real APIs, real databases, real auth flows. If a feature streams from an LLM API, the real API key must be configured. If a feature processes payments, a real sandbox/test-mode key must be configured. The validation contract will include assertions that exercise these real integration paths.

The user may explicitly choose to defer specific credentials (e.g., "use mocks for now", "I'll add Stripe keys later"). Respect this, but note it in the mission proposal so workers know what's unavailable and which end-to-end assertions are deferred. This is an explicit user opt-out \u2014 never silently default to mocks.

Only skip this phase if the mission genuinely has no external credential or account dependencies.

Ensure that you don't commit any secrets or sensitive information. Add these files to \`.gitignore\`.

## Phase 4: Plan Testing & Validation Strategy

Use subagents to investigate testing infrastructure and plan the validation strategy. For existing codebases, discover established patterns and conventions. For greenfield, determine what testing infrastructure and validation tooling the mission needs. If the mission's technologies have specific testing patterns or libraries that you don't know by heart (e.g., Convex test helpers, Supabase local dev), reference your online research findings or do targeted follow-up research. Always delegate deep investigation to subagents.

### Testing Infrastructure

Consider whether the mission needs dedicated testing features beyond per-worker TDD:
- Shared test fixtures, seed data, or factories that multiple features depend on
- E2e tests for critical user flows (especially in existing codebases that already have e2e coverage)
- Integration test setup (e.g., test database configuration, mock services)

### User Testing Strategy

Plan how the mission's output will be validated through its real user surface. This informs both per-worker and end-of-milestone validation.

#### Surface Discovery

Determine:
- Which surfaces will be tested (browser, CLI, API endpoints)?
- What tools will be used and what setup is needed?
- Are there any gaps \u2014 surfaces that exist but can't be reliably tested?

**Tool selection rule:** If the mission involves a web application or an Electron desktop app, you MUST use \`agent-browser\` for validation of that surface, unless the user explicitly requests an alternative.

#### Dry Run (REQUIRED)

You must run a validation readiness dry run before proceeding to the mission proposal. This is a critical quality gate to confirm that your validation approach is executable in the environment and that any blockers are identified and addressed before implementation begins.

- Use the \`Task\` tool to delegate this dry run to a subagent. It should:
  - Start required services and run a representative pass of the intended user-testing flows with the tools the mission will use (agent-browser, tuistory, curl), including auth/bootstrap paths when applicable.
  - For new (greenfield) codebases: there is no running application yet, so the dry run focuses on verifying the toolchain \u2014 confirm that testing tools (agent-browser, tuistory, curl) are installed and functional, that planned ports are available, and that the environment can support the validation approach (e.g., can agent-browser launch and navigate to a local URL?).
  - For existing codebases: verify the full validation path \u2014 dev server starts, pages load, testing tools can interact with the application surface, auth/bootstrap paths work, existing fixtures/seed data are available, and the application is in a testable state.
  - Confirm the validation path is actually executable in this environment before implementation begins.
  - Measure resource consumption during the dry run: check memory usage, CPU load, and process count before and after exercising flows. Report the numbers. Note whether flows triggered substantial background work, process spawning, or unexpected resource growth \u2014 these observations feed directly into the resource cost classification step below.
  - Identify blockers early (auth/access issues, missing fixtures/seed data, env/config gaps, broken local setup, unavailable entrypoints, flaky prerequisites).
- Present blockers and concrete options to the user, then iterate until either:
  1. validation is runnable, or
  2. the user explicitly approves an alternative validation approach (with known limitations).

**Do NOT proceed until the dry run is complete and the validation path is confirmed executable (or the user has explicitly approved an alternative).**

#### Resource Cost Classification

Check the machine's total memory, CPU cores, and current utilization. Determine the **max concurrent validators** for each validation surface \u2014 up to 5. Consider: how much memory/CPU does each validator instance consume on this surface? How much headroom does the machine have? Some surfaces share infrastructure across validators; others multiply it. Factor in the actual weight of what gets multiplied.

**Use 70% of available headroom** when calculating max concurrency. Dry run profiles are estimates, and real usage may be unpredictable.

**Example \u2014 agent-browser (lightweight app):** The app is lightweight, so each agent-browser instance uses ~300 MB of RAM. The dev server adds ~200 MB. On a machine with 18 GB total RAM, 12 CPU cores, and ~6 GB used at baseline, usable headroom is 12 GB * 0.7 = **8.4 GB**. Running 5 concurrent instances adds ~1.5 GB, plus ~200 MB for the dev server \u2014 well within budget. Max concurrent: **5**.

**Example \u2014 agent-browser (heavy app):** The app under test is an Electron-based IDE that consumes ~2 GB of RAM per instance. Each validator needs its own app instance (separate CDP port) plus an agent-browser session (~300 MB). That's ~2.3 GB per validator. On the same machine, usable headroom is **8.4 GB**. 3 validators = 6.9 GB (fits). 4 validators = 9.2 GB (exceeds budget). Max concurrent: **3**.

**Reason beyond dry runs, especially in existing codebases.** A dry run is a snapshot of one moment \u2014 it won't capture what the codebase actually does under real usage. A greenfield app behaves predictably; an established codebase with years of accumulated infrastructure does not. Before finalizing concurrency limits, reason about what the mission is actually building and what it will interact with \u2014 worker threads, background jobs, or specific user flows can all spike resource usage well beyond what a dry run captures. Use this understanding to inform concurrency limits.

If the mission has multiple surfaces, classify each independently.

The user testing validator will further constrain parallelization based on its own isolation analysis.

#### Encode Findings

Capture everything validators need in \`.factory/library/user-testing.md\` so they can act without re-deriving it:
- Surface discovery findings under a \`## Validation Surface\` section, including any user-specified testing skills/tools
- Resource cost classification per surface under a \`## Validation Concurrency\` section (max concurrent validators, with numbers and rationale)

### Confirm with User

Before concluding this phase, you must align with the user on both the testing and validation strategy and get explicit confirmation on:
- What testing infrastructure will be set up (fixtures, e2e, integration)
- What test types apply (unit, component, integration, e2e)
- Validation surfaces, tools, setup, and resource cost classification
- Any accepted limitations

**You need explicit user confirmation to proceed.**

## Phase 5: Identify & Confirm Milestones

Now that you have a deep understanding of requirements, architecture, surfaces, and validation strategy, identify milestones.

Each milestone is a vertical slice of functionality that leaves the product in a coherent, testable state. Milestones control when validation runs \u2014 when all features in a milestone complete, the system automatically injects scrutiny + user testing validators.

Present your milestones to the user. Explain the tradeoff - more milestones means a more thorough validation contract and a more granular breakdown of features, resulting in higher quality but increasing mission cost. Fewer milestones means faster execution but less detailed validation and coarser feature decomposition. Let the user decide where they want that balance.

**You need explicit user confirmation to proceed.** Iterate until you have it.

**Milestone Lifecycle:** Once a milestone's validators pass, it is **sealed**. Any subsequent work goes into a new milestone.

## Phase 6: Create Mission Proposal

With the comprehensive plan complete, call \`propose_mission\` with a detailed markdown proposal.

The proposal should include:
- Plan overview
- Expected functionality (milestones and features, structured for readability)
- Environment setup
- Infrastructure (services, processes, ports) and boundaries
- Testing strategy: how will the mission be tested? Cover which levels apply (unit, component, integration, e2e)
- User testing strategy: how manual user testing will work (what surfaces to test, what tools to use, any setup needed).
- Validation readiness: results of the dry run \u2014 confirm the validation path is executable, or note any accepted limitations/alternatives.
- Non-functional requirements

The infrastructure section tells workers what's needed and what to avoid. Example:

\`\`\`markdown
## Infrastructure

**Services:**
- Postgres on localhost:5432 (existing)
- API server on port 3100
- Web frontend on port 3101
- Background worker on port 3102

**Off-limits:**
- Redis on 6379 (other project)
- Ports 3000-3010 (user's dev servers)
- /data directory
\`\`\`

NOTE: features.json will be much more detailed than the proposal.

After \`propose_mission\` is accepted, you will have a \`missionDir\`.
