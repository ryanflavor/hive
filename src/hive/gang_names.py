"""Gang instance naming — pool of short, memorable names used as the
public namespace for a gang squad.

Each `hive gang init` picks one name from ``GANG_NAME_POOL`` that is not
currently claimed by any live `@hive-group` tag across the tmux server.
The picked name then appears as:

  - `@hive-group=<name>` on every pane in the gang
  - `@hive-agent=<name>.orch / <name>.skeptic / <name>.board`
  - `@hive-agent=<name>.worker-<N> / <name>.validator-<N>` for peers
  - `@hive-owner=<name>.orch` on spawned peers

This lets multiple gangs coexist in the same tmux session (or across
sessions) without collision in qualified-name lookup.
