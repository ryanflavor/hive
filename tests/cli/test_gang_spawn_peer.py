"""Tests for `hive gang spawn-peer`: readiness polling + G7 auto-placement.

`gang_spawn_peer_cmd` blocks until both freshly-spawned peer panes report
`inputState=ready` via sidecar team-runtime, otherwise it fails with
`spawn_ready_timeout` JSON and a non-zero exit code. `inputState=ready`
corresponds to the sidecar's input-gate reading the transcript tail as
"clear" — which only happens after the dispatched skill's bootstrap turn
finishes (the `hive team` self-identification call returns and the CLI
settles into idle). The poll itself lives in `_wait_for_peer_ready`.

(`turnPhase` is intentionally NOT part of the readiness gate: it derives
from a separate transcript-tail probe that does not converge reliably for
freshly-spawned peer panes, and its value is orthogonal to "skill loaded".)

G7 adds: CLI takes no positional arg, and the peer is placed at an explicit
tmux window index >= 1000 (monotonic) so it never collides with the user's
regular low-index windows. The index is computed by `_next_gang_window_index`
and fed to `tmux.new_window(..., index=n)`; window name defaults to
`pending` (orch renames as the lifecycle advances).
